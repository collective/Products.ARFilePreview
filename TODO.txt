FilePreview is an archetypes based product. It might be an adaptor that would provide the preview and indexing feature to any object that implements IFile.

There are still questions that need to be investigated in the adapter perspective :

- in FilePreview, the html preview is the one that gets indexed. This allows to have only one transformation from binary file.
It  is faster than doing one transformation for 'binary to html' for the preview and another 'binary to text' for indexing.

- the preview needs to be displayed in an extension of the original template, or a fixed template added as another view for the object ?

- the original file is indexed in the original schema ; should we disable this feature and index the preview as it is now ?
